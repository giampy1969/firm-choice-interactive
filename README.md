This is a MATLAB&reg; live editor file that interactively illustrates the price choice of a monopolistic firm, as explained in chapter 7, "The firm and its customers" of the book "The Economy", from The CORE Econ Team, Open access: https://www.core-econ.org/the-economy/v1/book/text/07.html. 

The case of a price-taking firm in a competitive market (chapter 8, "Supply and demand: Price-taking and competitive markets" is included as the particular case in which the demand curve is flat (that is price is constant).

Use sliders to change the coefficients of the (quadratic) cost and (linear) demand function, as well as the axis limit. The plot then updates the shape of the functions (including the marginal, average and total cost curves), and the location of the solution (the chosen price and quantity). Displayed quantities like the equilibrium price and quantity, the consumer and producer surpluses, and the deadweight loss, are also updated.

The capability to quickly experiment with different cost and demand functions makes it much easier to understand the basic economics concepts explained in the chapter.
